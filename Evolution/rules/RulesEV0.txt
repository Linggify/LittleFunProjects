- A number of cell colonies is distributed over the map
- Each cell has a DNA which is a mini program, controlling its toughness, strength and reproduction
	- reproduction is only possible if there is a non occupied cell next to the "reproducing" cell
	- reproduction ALWAYS mutates the new cells DNA
	
- If two cells of different species are adjected they will battle, leading to reduced toughness and maybe death of one of the two, or both
- A cell looses its toughness each simulation step
- A cell can heal of friendly cells and thereby slow down the process of death
